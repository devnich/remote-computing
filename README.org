#+TITLE: Introduction to Remote Computing
#+AUTHOR: Derek Devnich

* Orientation
This is an introduction to the fundamental system administration skills a researcher will need when interacting with a Unix-like server. It is not an introduction to HPC or Containers; rather, it is intended to make explanations of HPC or Containers transparent.

* Authentication
1. Public keys and public key setup
2. Windows problems and work-arounds
3. RSA is Bad, and other cryptographic right answers

* Using the terminal (SSH)
1. Tracking your environment
2. Shell commands
3. Latency
4. Using editors

* Moving files (SFTP)
1. Many parallel connections
2. Managing multiple terminal (benefits, dangers, focus follows mouse)

* Permissions
1. Permission basics
2. Changing permissions
   1. Intuitive commands
   2. Permission masks
3. Owners and groups
   1. Changing owners
   2. Managing groups
4. Passwords

* File management
1. find
2. grep
3. Writing information to files
4. moving, copying, deleting
5. making archives
6. <database> dump

* Getting files
1. wget and curl
2. git

* Utilities
1. df
2. du
3. top
4. cron
5. Installing better utilities (package managers)

* Becoming Root
1. sudo
2. su
3. With great power comes great responsibility

* Starting and stopping processes
1. OS level commands (e.g., kill)
2. Utility level commands (e.g., mysql restart)
3. Rebooting

* When things go wrong
1. Logs
2. Testing
3. Startup scripts and configuration
4. Self-healing systems and the limits thereof

* A very brief discussion of research computing
1. High-Performance Computing (running discrete jobs)
2. Containers (persistent environments)

* COMMENT How to export this document to other formats
** Export to Markdown using Pandoc
Do this if you want code syntax highlighting and a table of contents on Github.
*** Generate generic Markdown file
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pandoc README.org -o tmp.md
#+END_SRC

*** Edit generic Markdown file to remove illegal front matter
1. Org directives
2. Anything that isn't part of the document structure (e.g. TODO items)

*** Generate Github Markdown with table of contents
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pandoc -f markdown --toc --toc-depth=2 -s tmp.md -o README.md
#+END_SRC

*** Find and replace code block markers in final document
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x qrr " {.python}" "python"
M-x qrr " {.bash}" "bash"
M-x qrr " example " fundamental
#+END_EXAMPLE
